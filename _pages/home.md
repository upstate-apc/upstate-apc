We are a dynamic research group at the [Upstate Medical University](https://www.upstate.edu) [Division of Rheumatology](https://www.upstate.edu/rheumatology/). We study human autoimmune diseases, particularly Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE); our aim is to explore and understand the role of [antigen-presenting cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen-presenting_cell), particularly myeloid dendritic cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells.
